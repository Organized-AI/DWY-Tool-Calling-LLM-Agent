"Show me how to add better error handling to the DeepInvent.ai API integration"
```

### **Phase 3: Integration and Advanced Features (15 minutes)**

#### **Connect Multiple Workshops**
Navigate to `reference-implementation/complete-agent/src/agent.js` and ask:
```
"I want to modify this agent to prioritize Workshop 1 (planning) whenever someone asks about project management. How do I do that?"
```

#### **Add Platform Integrations**
```
"Help me add real API integration for DeepInvent.ai in the complete agent. Show me the authentication and error handling patterns."
```

#### **Create Custom Workshop Components**
```
"I want to create a new workshop component for Workshop 7 that handles project deployment. Can you help me create the file structure and basic implementation following the existing patterns?"
```
