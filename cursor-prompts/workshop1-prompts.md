## ðŸš€ **Master Prompt for Workshop 1**

```
Hi! I'm working on Workshop 1 of the DWY Tool Calling LLM Agent project. I'm a beginner vibe coder and need your help building the foundation layer.

Here's what I want to achieve:
1. Set up a complete development environment for AI agent development
2. Integrate with DeepInvent.ai for patent applications and innovation tracking  
3. Create a project planning system with AI assistance
4. Build the foundation architecture that other workshops will build on
5. Set up GitHub integration and version control

I want you to:
- Guide me through each step conversationally
- Write all the code and configuration files for me
- Explain what each part does so I understand
- Show me how to test everything works
- Make it beginner-friendly with clear explanations

The presenter is Jordaaan and the primary tool is DeepInvent.ai (https://deepinvent.ai/).

Let's start! What's the first step?
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Specific Feature Requests**

### **Development Environment Setup**
```
Help me set up the perfect development environment for building an AI agent. I need:
- Node.js project structure
- Package.json with all necessary dependencies  
- Environment variables configuration
- Basic folder structure for the 6 workshops
- Git repository initialization

Write all the files and show me exactly what to run.
```

### **DeepInvent.ai Integration**
```
I want to integrate DeepInvent.ai for patent applications and innovation management. Help me:
- Connect to the DeepInvent.ai API
- Create functions to submit patent applications
- Track innovation ideas and prior art research
- Store patent information in a simple database
- Build a basic UI to manage innovations

Show me the complete implementation.
```

### **Project Planning System**
```
Build me an AI-enhanced project planning system that can:
- Create and manage project timelines
- Track tasks and dependencies
- Allocate resources automatically
- Monitor progress with AI insights
- Generate project reports

Make it simple but powerful, with AI assistance throughout.
```

### **Foundation Architecture**
```
Design the foundation architecture for my 6-workshop AI agent system. I need:
- Modular design where each workshop adds a layer
- Clear interfaces between components
- Scalable structure for adding more features
- Integration points for the other 5 workshops
- Documentation of how everything connects

Create the complete architectural foundation.
```

### **Testing & Validation**
```
Now show me how to test everything we've built:
- Test the DeepInvent.ai integration
- Verify the project planning features work
- Check that the foundation architecture is solid
- Make sure everything is properly connected
- Create some example data to demonstrate functionality
```

### **Customization**
```
Help me customize this foundation for my specific needs:
- Modify the project planning for [YOUR INDUSTRY]
- Add additional innovation tracking features
- Customize the UI/UX for better usability
- Add error handling and validation
- Improve performance and optimization
```

### **Workshop 2 Preparation**
```
Prepare my foundation layer for Workshop 2 (Knowledge Graph Implementation):
- Add hooks for Neo4j integration
- Create data structures that will work with graph databases
- Set up interfaces for memory and context storage
- Ensure compatibility with Penumbra.ai
- Document integration points for the memory system
```
