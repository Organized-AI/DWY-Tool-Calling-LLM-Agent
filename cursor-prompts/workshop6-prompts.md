## ðŸ¤– **Master Prompt for Workshop 6**

```
Amazing! This is the final workshop - Workshop 6, where I add the AI brain that powers everything. I have the complete system: foundation (Workshop 1), memory (Workshop 2), marketing intelligence (Workshop 3), video generation (Workshop 4), and tool integration (Workshop 5). Now I need to add local AI deployment for privacy-focused, autonomous operation.

Here's what I want to achieve:
1. Deploy local AI models using Ollama for privacy-focused processing
2. Integrate WebAI.com for optimization and best practices
3. Create intelligent model selection based on task requirements
4. Implement privacy-first architecture with local-only processing
5. Connect the local AI to all my workshop components for autonomous operation

I want you to:
- Install and configure Ollama with optimized language models
- Set up WebAI.com integration for deployment optimization and monitoring
- Create intelligent model selection that chooses the right AI for each task
- Implement privacy-focused processing that keeps sensitive data local
- Build performance monitoring and optimization systems
- Connect the local AI to all my workshop tools for complete automation

The presenter is Hossein and the primary tool is WebAI.com (https://www.webai.com/).

Let's make my AI agent completely autonomous and private! What's the first step?
