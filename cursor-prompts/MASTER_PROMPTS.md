**The Ultimate Cursor Vibe Coding Experience**

---

## üöÄ **Getting Started - Copy This Master Prompt**

```
Hi Cursor! I want to build the complete DWY Tool Calling LLM Agent through our 6-workshop series. I'm a beginner vibe coder and want you to guide me through building a complete AI agent system using conversational development.

This is the progression I want to follow:
1. Workshop 1: Project Planning & Systems Foundation (DeepInvent.ai)
2. Workshop 2: Knowledge Graph Memory System (Penumbra.ai)
3. Workshop 3: Marketing AI Services & Business Intelligence (Sindarin.tech)
4. Workshop 4: AI Video Generation & Content Creation (Texel.ai)
5. Workshop 5: Tool Calling & MCP Integration (Toolhouse.ai)
6. Workshop 6: Local AI Deployment & Privacy-Focused Core (WebAI.com)

Each workshop builds on the previous ones to create a complete AI agent that can:
- Plan and manage projects with AI assistance
- Remember all conversations and decisions in a knowledge graph
- Communicate with customers using voice AI
- Generate marketing videos automatically
- Call external tools and APIs intelligently
- Run completely locally for privacy and control

I want you to:
- Guide me through each workshop step by step
- Write all the code and configuration files
- Explain everything so I understand how it works
- Show me how to test each component
- Connect each workshop to the previous ones
- Make it beginner-friendly with clear explanations

Let's start with Workshop 1! What's the first step to building my AI agent foundation?
```

## üìö **Workshop-by-Workshop Progression**

### **üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Foundation (Workshops 1-2)**
Build the core infrastructure and memory system:
- **Workshop 1**: Development environment, project planning, GitHub integration
- **Workshop 2**: Neo4j knowledge graph, persistent memory, context retrieval

**Combined Progress Check:**
```
Show me how my project planning system and memory system work together. Create a demo where I plan a project and the memory system captures all my decisions and reasoning.
```

### **üíº Phase 2: Business Intelligence (Workshops 3-4)**
Add business value and content creation:
- **Workshop 3**: Voice AI, marketing automation, customer analysis, ROI tracking
- **Workshop 4**: Video generation, brand consistency, multi-platform optimization

**Combined Progress Check:**
```
Demonstrate how my marketing AI and video generation work together. Create a complete marketing campaign that uses voice AI for customer research and generates videos automatically.
```

### **üîß Phase 3: Integration & AI Core (Workshops 5-6)**
Connect everything and add autonomous AI:
- **Workshop 5**: Tool calling, MCP server, workflow orchestration
- **Workshop 6**: Local AI models, privacy-focused processing, autonomous operation

**Final Integration Check:**
```
Show me my complete AI agent in action. Run a full business workflow that uses all 6 workshop components working together autonomously.
```

## üîÑ **Progressive Integration Prompts**

### **After Workshop 2: Foundation + Memory**
```
Now that I have foundation and memory systems, show me how they work together:
- How does the memory system capture my project planning decisions?
- Can I query the knowledge graph to see my development progress?
- How does the memory enhance my project planning with context?
```

### **After Workshop 4: Foundation + Memory + Business + Content**
```
With foundation, memory, marketing, and video systems built, demonstrate:
- A complete marketing campaign that creates videos and tracks customers
- How the memory system captures campaign performance and learnings
- How voice AI and video generation work together for customer engagement
```

### **After Workshop 6: Complete System**
```
Show me my complete AI agent in full autonomous operation:
- Run a complete business process using all workshop components
- Demonstrate how local AI enhances every component
- Show the knowledge graph capturing the entire business workflow
- Prove that everything works together seamlessly and privately
```
