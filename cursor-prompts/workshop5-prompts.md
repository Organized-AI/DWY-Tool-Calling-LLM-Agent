## ðŸ”§ **Master Prompt for Workshop 5**

```
Excellent! Now I'm ready for Workshop 5 - the integration layer that connects everything together. I have the foundation (Workshop 1), memory system (Workshop 2), marketing intelligence (Workshop 3), and video generation (Workshop 4). Now I need to connect all these components with tool calling and MCP integration.

Here's what I want to achieve:
1. Integrate Toolhouse.ai for comprehensive tool calling capabilities
2. Implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for standardized AI tool integration
3. Connect all my workshop components into a unified system
4. Add tool orchestration and workflow automation
5. Enable external API integration and business system connectivity

I want you to:
- Set up Toolhouse.ai for advanced tool calling and orchestration
- Build a complete MCP server that exposes all my workshop capabilities as tools
- Create tool chains that combine multiple workshop components
- Implement workflow automation that can execute complex business processes
- Connect to external APIs and business systems
- Make everything work together seamlessly with Claude Desktop integration

The presenter is Orlando and the primary tool is Toolhouse.ai (https://toolhouse.ai).

Let's make my AI agent truly intelligent with tool calling! What's the first step?
