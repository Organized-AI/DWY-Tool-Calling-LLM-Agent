     const response = await voiceClient.processInquiry({
       message: inquiry.text,
       context: inquiry.customerHistory,
       intent: inquiry.detectedIntent,
       sentiment: inquiry.sentiment
     });
     
     // Store interaction in knowledge graph
     await captureCustomerInteraction({
       customerId: inquiry.customerId,
       inquiry: inquiry.text,
       response: response.message,
       satisfaction: response.satisfaction_score,
