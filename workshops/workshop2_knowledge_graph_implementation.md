     apiKey: process.env.PENUMBRA_API_KEY,
     endpoint: 'https://api.getpenumbra.ai/v1',
     graphDatabase: 'neo4j://localhost:7687'
   };
   ```

### **Step 2: Knowledge Graph Schema Design** (10 minutes)

   CREATE (w1:Workshop {
     id: 'workshop1',
     name: 'Project Planning Systems',
     presenter: 'Jordaaan',
     duration: 30,
     sequence: 1,
     status: 'completed'
   });

     concept: 'Systems Thinking',
     description: 'Understanding component relationships in AI systems',
     mastery_level: 'intermediate',
     workshop_source: 'workshop1'
   });
   ```

2. **Relationship Patterns**
   ```cypher
   // Workshop progression relationships
   MATCH (w1:Workshop {id: 'workshop1'})
   MATCH (w2:Workshop {id: 'workshop2'})
   CREATE (w1)-[:PRECEDES]->(w2);
   
   // Decision influences relationships
   MATCH (d:Decision {id: 'dec_001'})
   MATCH (w:Workshop {id: 'workshop1'})
   CREATE (w)-[:RESULTED_IN]->(d);
   
   // Learning connections
   MATCH (l:Learning {id: 'learn_001'})
   MATCH (w:Workshop {id: 'workshop1'})
   CREATE (w)-[:TEACHES]->(l);
   ```

3. **Integration with Workshop Components**
   ```cypher
   // Component entities from Workshop 1
   CREATE (c1:Component {
     id: 'github_repo',
     name: 'GitHub Repository',
     type: 'version_control',
     workshop: 'workshop1',
     status: 'implemented'
   });
   
   CREATE (c2:Component {
     id: 'cursor_ide',
     name: 'Cursor IDE',
     type: 'development_environment',
     workshop: 'workshop1',
     status: 'configured'
   });
   
   // Component dependencies
   MATCH (c1:Component {id: 'github_repo'})
   MATCH (c2:Component {id: 'cursor_ide'})
   CREATE (c2)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(c1);
   ```

### **Step 3: Memory Capture Implementation** (10 minutes)
1. **Automated Decision Tracking**
   ```javascript
   // Decision capture function
   async function captureDecision(decision) {
     const session = driver.session();
     const query = `
       CREATE (d:Decision {
         id: $id,
         title: $title,
         description: $description,
         timestamp: datetime(),
         impact: $impact,
         rationale: $rationale,
         workshop: $workshop
       })
       RETURN d
     `;
     
     const result = await session.run(query, decision);
     await session.close();
     return result;
   }
   ```

2. **Learning Progress Tracking**
   ```javascript
   // Learning capture function
   async function captureLearning(learning) {
     const session = driver.session();
     const query = `
       MERGE (l:Learning {id: $id})
       SET l.concept = $concept,
           l.description = $description,
           l.mastery_level = $mastery_level,
           l.workshop_source = $workshop_source,
           l.updated_at = datetime()
       RETURN l
     `;
     
     const result = await session.run(query, learning);
     await session.close();
     return result;
   }
   ```

3. **Context Retrieval System**
   ```javascript
   // Context retrieval for AI assistance
   async function getWorkshopContext(workshopId) {
     const session = driver.session();
     const query = `
       MATCH (w:Workshop {id: $workshopId})
       OPTIONAL MATCH (w)-[:RESULTED_IN]->(d:Decision)
       OPTIONAL MATCH (w)-[:TEACHES]->(l:Learning)
       OPTIONAL MATCH (w)-[:CONTAINS]->(c:Component)
       RETURN w, collect(d) as decisions, 
              collect(l) as learnings, 
              collect(c) as components
     `;
