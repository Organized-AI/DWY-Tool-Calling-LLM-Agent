# Logo Integration Instructions

## Current Status: Logo File Needed

This directory contains the visual assets for the **Organized AI Dev Setup** project.

## Logo Integration

**Required File**: `logo.png`  
**Description**: Human-AI collaboration handshake logo with golden background  
**Current Status**: ðŸ“‹ **Needs to be added by user**

### To Complete Logo Integration:

1. **Save the logo image** you provided as `logo.png` in this `/assets/` directory
2. **Recommended specs**:
   - Format: PNG with transparency (if needed)
   - Size: 400x400px or higher for crisp display
   - Optimization: Web-optimized for fast loading

### Once Added, Logo Will Appear In:
- âœ… Main README.md (project header)
- âœ… project_overview.md (overview header)  
- âœ… Landing page index.html (hero section)
- âœ… Demo page assets/index.html
- âœ… All future documentation

### Current Integration Points:
All files are already configured to use `assets/logo.png` - they just need the actual image file to display properly.

**File paths expecting the logo:**
```
/assets/logo.png                    (main project)
../assets/logo.png                  (from docs)
./assets/logo.png                   (from root)
```

### Color Scheme Compatibility:
The golden/yellow background in your logo perfectly matches our implemented color palette:
- Primary Gold: #FFD700
- Amber Gold: #FFA000
- Orange Gold: #FF8F00

**Next Step**: Copy your logo image file and save it as `logo.png` in this directory!
