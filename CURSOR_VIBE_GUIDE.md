# DWY Tool Calling LLM Agent - Cursor Vibe Coding Guide
**Building AI Agents Through Conversation with Cursor**

## üéØ **Vibe Coding Philosophy**

This project is designed for **beginner vibe coders** using **Cursor IDE's Agent Chat**. Instead of writing complex code manually, you'll have **conversations with Cursor's AI** to build your complete AI agent system.

## ü§ñ **How to Use This Project**

### **Step 1: Open in Cursor IDE**
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the entire folder in Cursor IDE
3. Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to open Agent Chat
4. Start a conversation with: "Help me build the DWY Tool Calling LLM Agent"

### **Step 2: Follow the Conversation Flow**
Each workshop becomes a **conversation topic** with Cursor's AI:

```
You: "I want to start Workshop 1 - Project Planning Systems"
Cursor AI: "Great! Let's set up your development environment and integrate with DeepInvent.ai..."
```

## üé™ **Workshop Conversation Starters**

3. Create ROI tracking and business metrics
4. Add voice AI capabilities to my agent

Show me how to implement this with AI assistance.
```

### **Workshop 4: AI Video Generation (Rahul)**
**Cursor Chat Prompt:**
```
Let's add video creation to my AI agent with Workshop 4. I want to:
1. Connect to Texel.ai for AI video generation
2. Build automated video creation workflows
3. Add brand consistency and multi-platform optimization
4. Create video analytics and performance tracking

Guide me through building this conversationally.
```

### **Workshop 5: Tool Calling Integration (Orlando)**
**Cursor Chat Prompt:**
```
Now for the integration layer - Workshop 5. Help me:
1. Set up Toolhouse.ai for comprehensive tool calling
2. Implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
3. Connect all my workshop components together
4. Add tool orchestration and workflow automation

Walk me through connecting everything with AI assistance.
```

### **Workshop 6: Local AI Deployment (Hossein)**
**Cursor Chat Prompt:**
```
Final workshop - let's add the AI brain! Help me:
1. Install and configure Ollama for local AI
2. Use WebAI.com for optimization and best practices
3. Implement privacy-focused local AI processing
4. Connect the AI core to all my workshop components

Show me how to complete my AI agent system.
```

## üí¨ **Vibe Coding Tips for Cursor**

### **Be Conversational**
‚ùå **Don't say:** "Implement Neo4j database integration"
‚úÖ **Do say:** "I want to add a memory system to my AI agent so it remembers our conversations. Can you help me set up Neo4j and show me how to store and retrieve memories?"

### **Ask for Everything**
‚ùå **Don't say:** "Write a function"
‚úÖ **Do say:** "Create the complete file structure, write all the code, add error handling, and show me how to test it"

### **Reference the Context**
‚ùå **Don't say:** "Build an MCP server"
‚úÖ **Do say:** "Looking at my existing workshop components, help me build an MCP server that connects everything together"

### **Request Explanations**
‚ùå **Don't say:** "Just write the code"
‚úÖ **Do say:** "Write the code and explain what each part does so I can understand how it works"

## üöÄ **Complete Project Conversation**

**Master Prompt for Building Everything:**
```
I want to build the complete DWY Tool Calling LLM Agent following the 6-workshop progression. This is for beginner vibe coders using Cursor's AI assistance.

Start with Workshop 1 and guide me through each step conversationally:
1. Project Planning Systems (DeepInvent.ai)
2. Knowledge Graph Memory (Penumbra.ai) 
3. Marketing AI Services (Sindarin.tech)
4. AI Video Generation (Texel.ai)
5. Tool Calling Integration (Toolhouse.ai)
6. Local AI Deployment (WebAI.com)

For each workshop:
- Explain what we're building and why
- Write all the code and configuration files
- Show me how to test each component
- Connect it to the previous workshops
- Make it beginner-friendly with clear explanations

Let's start with Workshop 1!
```

## üé® **Cursor-Specific Features to Use**

### **Agent Chat (`Cmd+K`)**
- Have full conversations about implementation
- Ask for code explanations and modifications
- Request testing and debugging help

### **Inline Editing (`Cmd+K` on selected code)**
- Highlight code and ask Cursor to improve it
- Request specific changes: "Make this more efficient"
- Add features: "Add error handling to this function"

### **Code Generation (`Tab`)**
- Use Cursor's autocomplete for rapid development
- Let AI suggestions guide your implementation
- Accept and modify suggestions as needed

### **Chat with Codebase**
- Ask questions about your existing code
- "How does my knowledge graph connect to the marketing tools?"
- "Show me how to add a new workshop component"

## üìÅ **Expected File Structure After All Workshops**

```
